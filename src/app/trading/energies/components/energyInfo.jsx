                        ENERGY TRADING INVOLVES THE BUYING AND SELLING OF ENERGY COMMODITIES, SUCH AS OIL,
                        NATURAL GAS, AND ELECTRICITY, IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. ENERGY MARKETS ARE HIGHLY
                        DYNAMIC AND INFLUENCED BY A COMBINATION OF GEOPOLITICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND
                        ECONOMIC FACTORS. GLOBAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS ENERGY
                        DEMANDâ€”BOOMING ECONOMIES DRIVE CONSUMPTION HIGHER, WHILE ECONOMIC
                        DOWNTURNS TEND TO LOWER IT.

                        EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS, SUCH AS HURRICANES OR COLD WINTERS, CAN DISRUPT THE

                        AND HEATING OIL. THESE DISRUPTIONS CAN ALTER MARKET DYNAMICS AND IMPACT THE
                        DEMAND FOR RELATED CONSUMER SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, GEOPOLITICAL STABILITY IN
                        MAJOR NATURAL GAS-PRODUCING REGIONS CAN HAVE A NOTABLE IMPACT ON GLOBAL
                        ENERGY PRICES.

                        OIL TRADING, IN PARTICULAR, OPERATES AROUND THE CLOCK DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF

                        APPEALING FOR DAY TRADERS WHO AIM TO CAPITALIZE ON RAPID PRICE MOVEMENTS,
