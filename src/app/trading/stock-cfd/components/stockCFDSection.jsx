                        <strong>Stock CFD (Contract for Difference)</strong> trading allows
                        investors to speculate on the price movements of stocks without
                        actually owning the underlying shares. Instead, traders enter into
                        an agreement to exchange the difference in the stock's price between
                        the opening and closing of the trade.

                        <strong>Dividend Adjustments for Stock CFDs</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Since CFD traders do not own the underlying stocks, they are not
                        eligible for dividends directly. However, when a company pays
                        dividends, it reduces the stock's value by the dividend amount,
                        which is reflected in a lower share price when the market opens on
                        the ex-dividend date.
                    </p>
                    <p >
                        To maintain the balance of CFD positions, a dividend adjustment is
                        made for clients holding relevant CFD positions. This ensures that
                        tradersâ€™ open positions are not negatively impacted by the drop in
                        the share price due to dividend payouts.
                    </p>

                        The trading hours for each stock CFD vary and can be found in the
                        table above.
