            High Risk Investment Warning:
          </span>{" "}
          Contracts for Difference (CFDs) are complex financial products that
          are traded on margin. Trading CFDs carries a high degree of risk. It
          is possible to lose all your capital. These products may not be
          suitable for everyone and you should ensure that you understand the
          risks involved. Seek independent expert advice if necessary and
          speculate only with funds that you can afford to lose. Please think
          carefully whether such trading suits you, taking into consideration
          all the relevant circumstances as well as your personal resources. We
          do not recommend clients posting their entire account balance to meet
          margin requirements. Clients can minimise their level of exposure by
          requesting a change in leverage limit. For more information please
          refer to TETCâ€™s Risk Disclosure.
